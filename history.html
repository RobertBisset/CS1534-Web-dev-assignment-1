    <u><h1>Wars of Scottish Independence</h1></u>
    <p>
        During the Wars of Scottish Independence, 
        Aberdeen was under English rule, so Robert 
        the Bruce laid siege to Aberdeen Castle 
        before destroying it in 1308, followed by 
        executing the English garrison. The city 
        was burned by Edward III of England in 1336, 
        but was rebuilt and extended. The city was 
        strongly fortified to prevent attacks by 
        neighbouring lords, but the gates were 
        removed by 1770.

        During the Wars of the Three Kingdoms of 
        1644 to 1647 the city was plundered by both 
        sides. In 1644, it was taken and ransacked 
        by Royalist troops after the Battle of 
        Aberdeen and two years later it was stormed 
        by a Royalist force under the command of the 
        George Gordon, 2nd Marquis of Huntly. An 
        outbreak of bubonic plague over 1687 and 1688 
        killed 8.5% of the population, adding to the 
        economic and demographic damage caused by war. 
        In the 18th century, a new Town Hall was built 
        and the first social services appeared with 
        the Aberdeen Infirmary at Woolmanhill in 1739 
        and the Aberdeen Lunatic Asylum in 1800.

    <u><h1>Second World War</h1></u>
    <p>
        Over the course of World War II Aberdeen was 
        attacked 32 times by the German Luftwaffe. 
        One of the most devastating attacks was on 
        Wednesday 21 April 1943 when 29 Luftwaffe 
        Dornier 217s flying from Stavanger, Norway 
        attacked the city between the hours of 22:17 
        and 23:04. A total of 98 civilians and 27 
        servicemen were killed, along with 12,000 houses 
        damaged, after a mixture of 127 Incendiary, High 
        Explosive and Cluster bombs were dropped on the 
        city in one night.
