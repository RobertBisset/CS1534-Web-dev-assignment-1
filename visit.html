    <u><h1>Location and area</h1></u>
    <p>
        Being situated between two river mouths, 
        the city has little natural exposure of 
        bedrock. The small amount of geophysics 
        done, and occasional building-related 
        exposures, combined with small exposures 
        in the banks of the River Don, suggest that 
        it is actually sited on an inlier of 
        Devonian "Old Red" sandstones and silts. 
        The outskirts of the city spread beyond the 
        (inferred) limits of the outlier onto 
        the surrounding metamorphic/ igneous complexes 
        formed during the Dalradian period (approximately 
        480–600 million years ago) with sporadic areas of 
        igneous Diorite granites to be found, such 
        as that at the Rubislaw quarry which was 
        used to build much of the Victorian parts 
        of the city.

    <u><h1>Climate</h1></u>
    <p>
        Aberdeen features an oceanic climate (Köppen Cfb), 
        with far milder winter temperatures than one might 
        expect for its northern location. However, statistically 
        speaking, it is still the coldest city in the UK. 
        During the winter, especially throughout December, 
        the length of the day is very short, averaging 
        6 hours and 41 minutes between sunrise and sunset 
        at the winter solstice. As winter progresses, the 
        length of the day grows fairly quickly, to 8 hours and 
        20 minutes by the end of January. Around summer solstice, 
        the days will be around 18 hours long, having 17 hours 
        and 55 minutes between sunrise and sunset. During 
        this time of the year marginal nautical twilight lasts 
        the entire night. Temperatures at this time of year 
        hover around 17.0 °C (62.6 °F) during the day in most 
        of the urban area, though nearer 16.0 °C (60.8 °F) 
        directly on the coast, and around 18.0 to 19.0 °C 
        (64.4 to 66.2 °F) in the westernmost suburbs.
